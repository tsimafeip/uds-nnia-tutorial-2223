# Assignment 1

::: frame
##  Organization
- Late submissions (>10mins) will not be accepted unless previously agreed upon
- Other questions?
- How long did it take?
:::

- \emph{Tutor cue:} go through the assignment
- Questions?
- Did it work?
- Were you able to collaborate?

# Regression

> - What is the difference between classification and regression? \monocle
> - What is regression in terms of functions? \monocle
>   - Any function $f: F \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (from joint feature space to numbers)
> - What is _linear_ regression? \monocle
>   - $\hat{y} = x^T \cdot \theta + C$ (parameters $\theta, C$)

. . .

## Which of the following are regression (and linear/polynomial) models? \monocle
1. 5
2. $4\cdot x_1 + 5$
3. $4\cdot x_1 + 3\cdot x_2^2 + 5$
4. $4\cdot x_1 + 3\cdot x_1\cdot x_2 + 5$
5. $4\cdot x_1 + 3\cdot \sin(x_2^2) + 5$
<!-- escaping newlines is an ugly hack to be able to use $ (to align left) -->
6. $\begin{cases} \
      4\cdot x_1 + 5 \quad &\text{if} \, x_2 \ge 10 \\ \
      3\cdot x_1 + 4 \quad &\text{if} \, x_2 < 10 \
    \end{cases}$

# Regression

## Regression to Classification \think \think
Assume that we have a function that outputs a score for every class, e.g. \emph{Predict sentiment into (positive, negative, neutral)}:
$$
(15.0, -2.3, 4.1)
$$

> - How do we use this for classification? 
>   - Argmax
> - Can we get a probability distribution?
>   - Softmax: $\frac{\exp x_i}{\sum_k \exp x_k}$
