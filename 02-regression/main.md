# Regression

- What is the difference between classification and regression? \monocle
- 

## Regression to Classification \think \think
Assume that we have a function that outputs a score for every class, e.g. \emph{Predict sentiment into (positive, negative, neutral)}:
$$
(15.0, -2.3, 4.1)
$$

> - How do we use this for classification? 
>   - Argmax
> - Can we get a probability distribution?
>   - Softmax: $\frac{\exp x_i}{\sum_k \exp x_k}$

# Assignment 2
