# Assignment 8

TODO

# Recurrent Neural Networks

- What's an RNN?
- What's it used for? What input can it _consume_ and _produce_?
- How does it work?

## RNN cells

- vanilla RNN
- LSTM
- GRU

# Improvements

- Bidirectionality
  - Why?
- Multiple layers
  - How does that work?
  - Why would that be useful?

## PyTorch pecularities
- You can't have a "ragged tensor"
- All sequences in a batch must be _padded_ to the same length

# Assignment 9

- Start early
- Any questions?
