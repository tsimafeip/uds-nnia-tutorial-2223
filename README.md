## Contributing

Compile slides using pandoc and the provided script (handout includes notes and disables iterative lists):
- Slides: `./build.sh 01-introduction tutorial`
- Handout version: `./build.sh 01-introduction handout`
- Both: `./build.sh 01-introduction`

Make sure you have `pandoc` and `texlive` installed.
Usually the following should suffice `sudo apt install pandoc texlive-latex-base texlive-pictures texlive-latex-recommended`. For Mac `brew install pandoc` and reopening terminal worked fine.
You don't need to build the presentations if you want to contribute - editing the markdown is enough.
