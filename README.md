# UdS NNIA Tutorials

Slides for Neural Networks Implementation and Application tutorials of Winter 2021 at University of Saarland.

## Outline

Schedule (links provided only to semi-finished materials):
- [Introduction](01-introduction/handout.pdf)
- TODO

## Contributing

Compile slides using pandoc and the provided script (handout includes notes and disables iterative lists):
- Slides: `./build.sh machine-translation tutorial`
- Handout version: `./build.sh machine-translation handout`
- Both: `./build.sh machine-translation`

Make sure you have `pandoc` and `texlive` installed.
You don't need to build the presentations if you want to contribute - editing the markdown is enough.
If you still wish to compile them (great!) and encounter technical issues, contact me.
